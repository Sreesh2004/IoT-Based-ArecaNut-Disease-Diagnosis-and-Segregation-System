## ðŸš€ Project Overview

**IoT-Based Areca Nut Disease Diagnosis and Segregation System** is an integrated hardware + software solution that automatically detects diseases on areca nuts using computer vision (CNN), classifies them, and actuates a conveyor-driven segregation system â€” all monitored remotely via IoT.

This repo contains: dataset preparation scripts, model training code, Raspberry Pi inference scripts, and microcontroller (relay/motor) control logic.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- Real-time disease detection using a CNN model (TensorFlow / Keras).
- Automated conveyor segmentation with relay control.
- Remote monitoring and alerts via IoT dashboard (Blynk or similar).
- Lightweight inference optimized for Raspberry Pi 3B+ (or similar).
- Modular: swap model, dataset, or hardware easily.
